		<dt><b>Quadratic function</b></dt>
		<dd>In mathematics, a quadratic polynomial is a polynomial of degree two in one or more variables. A quadratic function is the polynomial function defined by a quadratic polynomial. A quadratic function is one of the form f(x) = ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are numbers with a not equal to zero.
		</dd>
		
		<dt><b>What is a quadratic function example?</b></dt>
		<dd>A quadratic function has a term to the second power. An example would be x^2 - 4x + 3. There are several forms in which a quadratic function can be written.
		</dd>
		
		<dt><b>What are quadratic functions?</b></dt>
		<dd>
		Quadratic functions are polynomials with terms to the second degree. In other words, a term in the equation can be to the power of two, but not higher.
		</dd>
		
		<dt><b>What is the range of a quadratic?</b></dt>
		<dd>
		The range refers to all possible values of y. To find the range, determine the vertex. If the parabola opens up, the range includes the y-value of the vertex and all numbers greater than it. If the parabola opens down, the range includes the y-value of the vertex and all numbers less than it.
		</dd>
		
		<dt><b>What are the 3 quadratic formulas?</b></dt>
		<dd>
		Standard form is one, written as f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Factored form is another, which is written as f(x) = (x - p)(x - q). A third form is  vertex form, written as f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k.
		</dd>						</div>
    <div class="slide"><dt><b>Linear function</b></dt>
<dd>
Linear function is a function which forms a straight line in a graph. It is generally a polynomial function whose degree is utmost 1 or 0. Although the linear functions are also represented in terms of calculus as well as linear algebra. The only difference is the function notation.
</dd>

<dt><b>What is a linear function example?</b></dt>
<dd>
A linear function is a function that represents a straight line on the coordinate plane. For example, y = 3x - 2 represents a straight line on a coordinate plane and hence it represents a linear function. Since y can be replaced with f(x), this function can be written as f(x) = 3x - 2.
</dd>

<dt><b>What are linear functions?</b></dt>
<dd>
Linear functions are those whose graph is a straight line. A linear function has the following form. y = f(x) = a + bx. A linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable. The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y.
</dd>

<dt><b>What is the range of a linear function?</b></dt>
<dd>
Linear functions (almost) always have infinite domains and ranges. The exception is when the graph is a horizontal line. This happens for functions that equal a constant such as f(x) = b. These functions have infinite domains but a range that has only one value, b.
</dd>

</div>
    <div class="slide"><dt><b>Rational function</b></dt>
<dd>
A rational function is defined as the quotient of polynomials in which the denominator has a degree of at least . In other words, there must be a variable in the denominator.
</dd> 

<dt><b>What is a  rational function example?</b></dt>
<dd>
Any function of one variable, x, is called a rational function if, it can be represented as f(x) = p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials such that q(x) ≠ 0. For example, f(x) = (x2 + x - 2) / (2x2 - 2x - 3) is a rational function and here, 2x2 - 2x - 3 ≠ 0.
</dd>

<dt><b>What are rational function?</b></dt>
<dd>
A rational function is one that can be written as a polynomial divided by a polynomial. Since polynomials are defined everywhere, the domain of a rational function is the set of all numbers except the zeros of the denominator.
The general form of a rational function is <b>p(x)/q(x)<b>, where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials and q(x)≠0.
</dd> 

<dt><b>What is the range of a rational function?</b></dt>
<dd>
The parent function of a rational function is f(x)=1x and the graph is a hyperbola . The domain and range is the set of all real numbers except 0 .
